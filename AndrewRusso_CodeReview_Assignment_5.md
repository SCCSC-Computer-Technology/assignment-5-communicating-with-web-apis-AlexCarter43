There’s not much to say i think it looks good. The only thing I would suggest is turning your connection string into something like “DefaultConnection”. This would help future proof. This way if the address changes you’d only have to adjust it in one location, rather than hunting through your code for each instance of “https://localhost:7120/api/StudentProfiles”. This could help reduce errors if the host or hosting service for the data changes.
